# CyberPunk-v2
The game takes place in the year 3102. A small cyber punk town. Very limited amount of population which casually gathers to watch the slaves fight for survival. 

Overview: Parallel universe where ancient history repeasts itselfat. Gladiator battles similar to anciet Rome but with a plot twist.
Spectators gather around a small arena to cheer for their favourite slave. The ground tiles slowly gets destroyed one by one until there is no left. 
This is a find for the last standing man that will be the winner.

Young Io yelled at the crowd after winning his first battle: "Are you not entertained?"

## Getting started

In order for the game run, we need a host. Therefore, the first step is to host a game so that other people can connect. The capacity is 10, playinga
at the same time. To do this, click "PLAY" -> "Start as Host" ..... Enjoy your experience.

To join a host game, "PLAY" -> "New Game/Join Game".

The first two people that connect are automatically spawned in the arena (including the host). The ones after that are located outside of the arena
with the cheering crowd, surrounded by different types of activities.

The players can simply: 
```
- Move (W,S,A,D)
- Jump (Space)
- Crouch (Ctrl)
- Dance (Hold F)
- Taunt (Hold E)
- Talk (Hold T)
- Shoot snowballs (Left Mouse) / Not very functional except for visual effects
```
After dying, you're automatically redirected to the Main Menu. 

There is no winning screen, if you manage to outlive the other player, you'll eventually die and be redirected as well.

The game is essentially orientated around the aesthetics, due to the fact that most Arena Brawl Fighting games (e.g. UFC or even FIFA), are not
that focused on the environment. This is what we aimed in this project, not only showing the player how to fight, but also that there is way more beyond that.

There are multiple AI with different animations for different curcimstances:
- Cheering, Talking, Arguing, Sitting n Cheering, Giving CPR, Receiving CPR, Dancing in front of clubs etc..

Two clubs with music.

The envrioment is rich if you look at the sky.
